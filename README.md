# Iris Dataset

## Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains information about 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. There are 50 samples from each species, where each sample includes four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

## Files
- `iris.csv`: Contains the dataset in CSV format.
- `iris.names`: Description of the dataset and its attributes.

## Attributes
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)
5. Class:
   - Iris Setosa
   - Iris Versicolor
   - Iris Virginica

## Usage
The Iris dataset is often used for learning and practicing machine learning techniques such as classification. It's a good dataset for beginners to start with due to its simplicity and straightforward nature.

## Source
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- The dataset can be imported directly using Seaborn's `load_dataset` function, which provides a convenient way to load sample datasets for exploration and learning in Python.

## License
The dataset is public domain and can be freely used for any purpose.
